SMOB - a framework for open, distributed and semantic microblog
===============================================================

SMOB provides a decentralized system for microblogging, consisting of
various SMOB hubs that interact each others to share messages.
Each hub also exposes its data in RDFa, and provides ways to link
microblog post to URIs from the Linking Open Data Cloud.

The code is accessible via Subversion using the following command:

  svn co http://smob.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/


Requirements
------------

1. You need to have a server on the internet to set up the service on - this
   is like a blog.

2. The server needs to have 
  - a WWW server with PHP5 or higher.
  - MySQL 4.0.4 or higher.

3. PHP needs to have the CURL functions.
  - For example, in Debian the package is called php5-curl or php4-curl
  - Or, you can download libcurl from http://curl.haxx.se/dlwiz/?type=lib


Installation
------------

1. Checkout or download the SMOB source code and put it in a web server 
   directory that can be accessed by you as well as by the SMOB servers 
   on which you want to publish your data / SMOB clients you want to 
   aggregate, e.g. at http://example.org/smob

2. Go to http://example.org/smob and follow the instructions

3. Enjoy
