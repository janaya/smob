SMOB client - a personal microblog publishing service
=====================================================

The SMOB client enables you to publish your microblog postings. It 
provides a web interface for entering new postings, stores the postings, 
and lets the aggregators of your choice know of each new posting.

The SMOB client complements the SMOB server, which lets you set up your own
microblog aggregators.


Installation
------------

1. Copy config_dist.php to config.php and edit the parameters.
  -  If you don't have a FOAF profile yet:
    - You can create one eg. here: http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic
  - Tailor the list of SMOB servers to which you want to be able to push data.

4. Allow the client to create files in the 'data' directory.
  - Eg. the command: chmod 1777 data

5. Move this 'client' directory to a web server directory that can be accessed 
   by you as well as by the SMOB servers on which you want to publish your 
   data.

6. You can add access control rules (password, IP address) to a .htaccess file.
  - Access to the 'publish' directory controls publishing new posts.
  - Access to the 'data' directory controls read access to existing posts.

7. That's all! You can now access the client with a web browser.
