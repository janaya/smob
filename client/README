SMOB client - a personal microblog publishing service
=====================================================

The SMOB client enables you to publish your microblog postings. It 
provides a web interface for entering new postings, stores the postings, 
and lets the aggregators of your choice know of each new posting.

The SMOB client complements the SMOB server, which lets you set up your own
microblog aggregators.


The code is accessible via Subversion using the following command:

  svn co http://smob.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/client


Requirements
------------

1. You need to have a server on the internet to set up the service on - this
   is like a blog.

2. The server needs to have a WWW server with PHP5 or PHP4.

3. PHP needs to have the CURL functions.
  - For example, in Debian the package is called php5-curl or php4-curl
  - Or, you can download libcurl from http://curl.haxx.se/dlwiz/?type=lib


Installation
------------

1. Copy config_dist.php to config.php and edit the parameters.
  -  If you don't have a FOAF profile yet:
    - You can create one eg. here: http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic
  - Tailor the list of SMOB servers to which you want to be able to push data.

4. Allow the client to create files in the 'data' directory.
  - Eg. the command: chmod 1777 data

5. Move this 'client' directory to a web server directory that can be accessed 
   by you as well as by the SMOB servers on which you want to publish your 
   data.

6. You can add access control rules (password, IP address) to a .htaccess file.
  - Access to the 'publish' directory controls publishing new posts.
  - Access to the 'data' directory controls read access to existing posts.

7. The client allows you to publish data to your Twitter account.
  - Just fill the twitter_user and twitter_pas values in the config.php file

8. That's all! You can now access the client with a web browser.


Example .htaccess file
----------------------

To stop others from publishing as you using your publisher, you can put 
the following lines (please adjust accordinly) into publish/.htaccess:

Require valid-user
Order deny,allow
Deny from all
Satisfy any

AuthType Basic
AuthName "Tuukka's SMOB publisher"
AuthUserFile /home/tuukka/.auth-me

# You can list IP addresses where the password shouldn't be required
Allow from 123.456.0.789


Then, create the authentication file and an account with the command:
htpasswd -c /home/tuukka/.auth-me tuukka
