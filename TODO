[x] 1. svn to git migration
[] 2. Update project page to inform about github code migration

[x] 3. Add publication and subscription to an external hub capability
    * index.php
    [] Add new following : needed to check if the following already exists?
    [] Ping to update the followers list remotely: the URL will work only if $u
      doesn't have /me or /X in the end   
    [] Remove a follower: notify the remote_user to remove local_user as following?
	  Should also make the follower to send unsubscribe request to the Hub?
    [] Remove following: notify the the remote_user to remove local_user as follower?
    [] Remove following: how to know the Hub to remove subscription?, 
      whet again the publisher feed?, 
      should the Hub be stored as an RDF triple?, for instance:
      "following has_hub remote_hub"
    [] Detect when publisher changes Hub 
     (and unsubscribe from old one/subscribe to new one)
    * install.php 
    [] Ask the user (publisher) which Hub to use?, where to store it, config.php, triple?

[] 4. Fix undefined variables warnings
[] 5. Some constants in config.php are wroten again after installation when config.php is writable by apache
[] 6. Fix session warnings generated by htpasswd authentication
[x] 7. Improve documentation

[] 8. Include Websockets

[x] 9. Change Publisher to send the graph instead of RSS:
      The publisher topic could be:
       * http://smob.domain.com/rdf (a URL that provides all RDF). It can't be "http://smob.domain.com/data/2011-03-31T22:55:46+02:00" because it changes for every new post, or 
       * the new RDF to be LOADed in the subscribers, or
       * directly the SPARQL query for the subscriber, i.e.: "LOAD ..."
     [x] Hub complains about "Could not find any record for topic URL: http://smob.domain.com/rdf" or "...<?xml version..."
      Solution: parse and convert the RSS back to RDF in subscriber?  

[] 11. Creator tag is empty in /me/rss with HTTP authentication

[x] 12. Create another RSS link where RDF is included as content:encoded tag. This is another solution for #9.
